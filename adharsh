Thanks for sharing the code screenshot! The reason your “additional text” isn’t showing properly is because of incorrect HTML structure — specifically:


---

❌ Current problem:

<h1>Adber technologies
    thank you for visiting our page created by adharsh
    more features coming soon </h1>

You're putting all your sentences inside an <h1> tag. That’s not how it's meant to work — HTML treats it as one single heading line, so it ignores line breaks or formats badly.


---

✅ Here's how to fix it:

Replace:

<h1>Adber technologies
    thank you for visiting our page created by adharsh
    more features coming soon </h1>

With:

<h1>Adber technologies</h1>
<p>Thank you for visiting our page created by Adharsh.</p>
<p>More features coming soon.</p>

This uses <p> tags (paragraphs) for proper formatting.


---

✅ Final Improved Code Snippet:

Here's the cleaned-up version of your HTML (just the body part):

<body>
  <h1>Adber technologies</h1>
  <p>Thank you for visiting our page created by Adharsh.</p>
  <p>More features coming soon.</p>

  <h2>Created and maintained by Adharsh</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Only snake games available for now</li>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>
